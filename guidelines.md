# Guidelines

**These are temporary, we need to discuss them before they are confirmed.**

Daily meetings: 9:30am, plan before what you want to say, discuss what will be covered in meeting before it starts.
Reflection, feedback. Someone should take notes for team, everyone can have personal notes aswell. 

### First meeting:

* Agree on rules, roles and conventions.
* Everyone has an opportunity to propose rules.

### Ground rules:

1. Everyone must be heard - person standing is speaker, minimal interuption, give that person respect and priority.
2. Be open and don't hold back.
3. Compromise
4. Atleast 1 retro a day
5. Look out for eachother and have fun.


We need a way to be productive on GitHub without working on the same thing and messing things up. Agree on exactly what we are working on and inform group when moving to something else. Do not push without confirming with team about a change that hasn't been discussed.

## Communication

Slack + Trello

Trello list for files being worked on. Do not work on a file that has been chosen and do not start on a file until you have put it on the trello. When you are no longer working on a file, remove your name from it on the trello board.

## Roles

Needs work, temporary template:

*Members have control of their own area, they have final say on matters regarding those areas.*
