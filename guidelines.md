# Guidelines

**These are temporary, we need to discuss them before they are confirmed.**

Daily meetings: 9:30am
Reflection, feedback.

### Ground rules:

1. Everyone must be heard
2. Be open and don't hold back.
3. Compromise
4. Atleast 1 retro a day
5. Have fun!

We need a way to be productive on GitHub without working on the same thing and messing things up. Agree on exactly what we are working on and inform group when moving to something else. Do not push without confirming with team about a change that hasn't been discussed.

## Communication

Slack + Trello

Trello list for files being worked on. Do not work on a file that has been chosen and do not start on a file until you have put it on the trello. When you are no longer working on a file, remove your name from it on the trello board.
