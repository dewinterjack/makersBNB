# Guidelines

**These are temporary, we need to discuss them before they are confirmed.**

Daily meetings: 9:30am
Reflection, feedback.

We need a way to be productive on GitHub without working on the same thing and messing things up. Agree on exactly what we are working on and inform group when moving to something else. Do not push without confirming with team about a change that hasn't been discussed.

## Communication

Slack + Trello
